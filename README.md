# Machine Learning - Randomforest
This is an academic project provided by QUT. 

## Summary of project
The goal was to utilise multiple machine learning algorithms to analyse the same set of data to detemine which classifier would be the most accurate at predicting the image class label. 
This was a group project where my contributions analysed the randomforest classifier. 
This repo contains only my code for the project which is contained within the "assessment2_randomforest.ipynb" file.
